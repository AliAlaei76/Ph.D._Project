# Ph.D._Project
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a control system for a non-holonomic autonomous platform, specifically a Differential Wheeled Robot. Initially, the kinematic model of the robot was derived to understand its movement constraints and capabilities. Subsequently, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm was implemented to address both regulation and trajectory tracking problems in environments free of obstacles as well as those with obstacles. The control algorithm was designed to operate effectively under constraints on control inputs. The performance of the proposed control system was evaluated through simulations in MATLAB. The results demonstrate that the NMPC algorithm successfully manages the robotâ€™s trajectory and regulation tasks, exhibiting both effectiveness and accuracy in various scenarios.
